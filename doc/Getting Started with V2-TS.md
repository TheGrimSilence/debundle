# Getting Started with V2-TS

My workflow consists of [`Yarn 2`](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started) and [`TypeScript`](https://typescriptlang.org), as well as development using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## Yarn 2

`Yarn` has many advantages over `npm`, such as workspaces and zero-config modules. If you'd like to read further into Yarn, feel free to visit the link above. Getting started with Yarn 2 can be a headache for newcomers, so I encourage you to read [Installation](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install), and [Editor SDKs](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/editor-sdks) for getting started with using Yarn with VSC, and VIM. This will also fix issues found with resolving modules with TypeScript.

_**NOTE**: When using Visual Studio Code, make sure you are using the Workspace TypeScript version._

## TypeScript

`TypeScript` is used over standard ECMAScript to take advantage of new features with a simple `yarn up`, instead of requiring each developer to have the same Node version and setup. In addition to using current standards without needing preprocessors, TypeScript also allows us to catch errors ahead of compilation, and speed up development. There are plenty of other benefits, feel free to read up! ðŸ˜€
